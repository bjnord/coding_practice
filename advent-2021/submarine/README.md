# Submarine

Common functionality for my Elixir [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) solutions.

## Installation

The `mix.exs` files in the individual `day-nn` directories include this library with a relative `path`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:submarine, path: "../../submarine"},
  ]
end
```
