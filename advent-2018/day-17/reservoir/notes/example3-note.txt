About the time my input started getting in an infinite loop, I started to think of edge cases like a tunnel:

      +
..........
#.........
######....
#.........
#.#####...
#.#.......
#.######..
#......#..
#......#..
########..

Result (worked first time):

.......+..
.......X..
.#.....|..
.######|..
.#|||||||.
.#~#####|.
.#~#||||||
.#~######|
.#~~~~~~#|
.#~~~~~~#|
.########|

$ expr 20 + 15

Part 1 squares reached by water is: 35

$ expr 15

Part 2 squares containing water is: 15
