[Help] [2018 Day 22 (Part 2)] Answer drops lower than accepted answer when x/y bounds are expanded (self.adventofcode)

submitted 1 day ago * by dan_144

  One aspect of my Part 2 solution was allowing my path to search outside the bounds of the target's x,y coordinates. When I bound my search to (2x, y), I get the accepted answer for my input. However when I bound it by (3x, y), it reports that a shorter path is available. This resulted in one of my submitted answers being too low.

  Repo: https://github.com/dan144/aoc-2018

  Code in day22.py, input in input22, day22/ contains the output from runs with the search bound to 2 and 3 times the target x value.

  If someone else could run their solution against my input, I'm curious if this is a bug in my code or not.

  My input:

  depth: 11820
  target: 7,782

  Edit: sounds like I have a bug somewhere, which is exactly what I expected to hear. Thanks for all the confirmation! Will go back and review my code again now that it isn't the early hours of the morning.

  I get

  Answer 1: 6318

  Answer 2: 1075

  Without any bounds, just a bit of A* heuristics for the coordinates.

  Even without the heuristics still I find no shorter one :(

  I get the same from my code with Dijkstra's Algorithm.

  Can confirm, get the same.

  Removed the values to not spoiler.
