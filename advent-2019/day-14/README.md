# Day 14: Space Stoichiometry

## Part One

As you approach the rings of Saturn, your ship's **low fuel** indicator turns on. There isn't any fuel here, but the rings have plenty of raw material. Perhaps your ship's Inter-Stellar Refinery Union brand **nanofactory** can turn these raw materials into fuel.

You ask the nanofactory to produce a list of the **reactions** it can perform that are relevant to this process (your puzzle input). Every reaction turns some quantities of specific **input chemicals** into some quantity of an **output chemical**. Almost every **chemical** is produced by exactly one reaction; the only exception, `ORE`, is the raw material input to the entire process and is not produced by a reaction.

You just need to know how much `**ORE**` you'll need to collect before you can produce one unit of `**FUEL**`.

Each reaction gives specific quantities for its inputs and output; reactions cannot be partially run, so only whole integer multiples of these quantities can be used. (It's okay to have leftover chemicals when you're done, though.) For example, the reaction `1 A, 2 B, 3 C => 2 D` means that exactly 2 units of chemical `D` can be produced by consuming exactly 1 `A`, 2 `B` and 3 `C`. You can run the full reaction as many times as necessary; for example, you could produce 10 `D` by consuming 5 `A`, 10 `B`, and 15 `C`.

Suppose your nanofactory produces the following list of reactions:

```
10 ORE => 10 A
1 ORE => 1 B
7 A, 1 B => 1 C
7 A, 1 C => 1 D
7 A, 1 D => 1 E
7 A, 1 E => 1 FUEL

```

The first two reactions use only `ORE` as inputs; they indicate that you can produce as much of chemical `A` as you want (in increments of 10 units, each 10 costing 10 `ORE`) and as much of chemical `B` as you want (each costing 1 `ORE`). To produce 1 `FUEL`, a total of **31** `ORE` is required: 1 `ORE` to produce 1 `B`, then 30 more `ORE` to produce the 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 `A` (with 2 extra `A` wasted) required in the reactions to convert the `B` into `C`, `C` into `D`, `D` into `E`, and finally `E` into `FUEL`. (30 `A` is produced because its reaction requires that it is created in increments of 10.)

Or, suppose you have the following list of reactions:

```
9 ORE => 2 A
8 ORE => 3 B
7 ORE => 5 C
3 A, 4 B => 1 AB
5 B, 7 C => 1 BC
4 C, 1 A => 1 CA
2 AB, 3 BC, 4 CA => 1 FUEL

```

The above list of reactions requires **165** `ORE` to produce 1 `FUEL`:

-   Consume 45 `ORE` to produce 10 `A`.
-   Consume 64 `ORE` to produce 24 `B`.
-   Consume 56 `ORE` to produce 40 `C`.
-   Consume 6 `A`, 8 `B` to produce 2 `AB`.
-   Consume 15 `B`, 21 `C` to produce 3 `BC`.
-   Consume 16 `C`, 4 `A` to produce 4 `CA`.
-   Consume 2 `AB`, 3 `BC`, 4 `CA` to produce 1 `FUEL`.

Here are some larger examples:

-   **13312** `ORE` for 1 `FUEL`:
    
    ```

    14 VRPVC => 6 BMBT
    6 BHXH, 18 KTJDG, 12 WPTQ, 7 PLWSL, 31 FHTLT, 37 ZDVW => 1 FUEL
    6 WPTQ, 2 BMBT, 8 ZLQW, 18 KTJDG, 1 XMNCP, 6 MZWV, 1 RJRHP => 6 FHTLT
    15 XDBXC, 2 LTCX, 1 VRPVC => 6 ZLQW
    13 WPTQ, 10 LTCX, 3 RJRHP, 14 XMNCP, 2 MZWV, 1 ZLQW => 1 ZDVW
    5 BMBT => 4 WPTQ
    189 ORE => 9 KTJDG
    1 MZWV, 17 XDBXC, 3 XCVML => 2 XMNCP
    12 VRPVC, 27 CNZTR => 2 XDBXC
    15 KTJDG, 12 BHXH => 5 XCVML
    3 BHXH, 2 VRPVC => 7 MZWV
    121 ORE => 7 VRPVC
    7 XCVML => 6 RJRHP
    5 BHXH, 4 VRPVC => 5 LTCX
    
    ```
    

Given the list of reactions in your puzzle input, **what is the minimum amount of `ORE` required to produce exactly 1 `FUEL`?**

## Part Two

After collecting `ORE` for a while, you check your cargo hold: **1 trillion** (**1000000000000**) units of `ORE`.

**With that much ore**, given the examples above:

-   The 13312 `ORE`\-per-`FUEL` example could produce **82892753** `FUEL`.
-   The 180697 `ORE`\-per-`FUEL` example could produce **5586022** `FUEL`.
-   The 2210736 `ORE`\-per-`FUEL` example could produce **460664** `FUEL`.

Given 1 trillion `ORE`, **what is the maximum amount of `FUEL` you can produce?**

### Part Two Design

NaÃ¯vely dividing one trillion by the `ORE` cost per `1 FUEL` (from Part One) won't work, because each time there are chemicals left over that effectively you'd be throwing away, rather than reusing for the next round.

So we do this:

1. Run the refinery over multiple successive rounds, keeping the chemical remainders from each round as a stockpile for the next round. Keep doing this until a round finishes with no remainders. (Essentially the chemicals all have their own "cycle length", and eventually they will all hit 0 at the LCM of those cycle lengths.)

\[NOTE: Unfortunately, that first step takes too long for the puzzle input; more than 8 hours and it was still running. Next approach: Find the cycles independently for each chemical remainder, and then find their LCM, as with day-12.]

1. Sum up the ORE cost from those rounds. Now we know the integer ratio N `ORE` : M `FUEL`. 

1. Divide one trillion by N to see how much `FUEL` is generated by the bulk of the `ORE`. Then the remainder of the trillion is small enough to iterate `1 FUEL` at a time until our ore is exceeded.

Showing my work, here's a file I edited in [the best text editor](https://www.vim.org/) as I puzzled this out:

```
4 ORE => 4 A
5 ORE => 3 C
2 C => 2 B
3 A, 1 B => 1 FUEL

4 ORE gives 3 A (with an extra A wasted)
5 ORE gives 2 C (with an extra C wasted)
   which is 1 B (with an extra B wasted; B is same ore cost as C)

    ORE  A  Arem  B  Brem  C  Crem
 0  4+5  3   1    1   1    2   1
 1  4+0  3   2    1   0    -   1
 2  4+5  3   3    1   1    2   2
 3  0+0  3   0    1   0    -   2
 4  4+0  3   1    1   1    2   0
 5  4+0  3   2    1   0    -   0
 6  4+5  3   3    1   1    2   1
 7  0+0  3   0    1   0    -   1
 8  4+5  3   1    1   1    2   2
 9  4+0  3   2    1   0    -   2
10  4+0  3   3    1   1    2   0
11  0+0  3   0    1   0    -   0

12 FUEL takes 56 ORE (not 12 * 9 = 108)

you can see from the table that:
  A cycle length is 4
  B cycle length is 2
  C cycle length is 6

and LCM(4, 2, 6) = 12
```
